What is stored in each of the data files?

The X-Plane airport and navigation data is stored in a set of text files.  The file and/or folder names have changed with the release of X-Plane 9.0, but the scope of each file remains unchanged:

    *

Airports (including heliports and seaplane bases) are stored in the apt.dat file. 
 This includes basic airport and boundary information, runways (including runway lighting, approach lighting and VASI/PAPIs), taxiways, taxiway markings and lighting, default start-up locations and some airport 'furniture' (windsocks, taxiway signs, etc.). 
 This file does not include ILS data for an airport.
    *

      Navigation aids are stored in the earth_nav.dat file (nav.dat prior to X-Plane 9.0). 
 This file includes the location, ID, name frequency and range of global NDBs, VOR/VORTACs, 
DMEs, ILS components (localizers, glideslopes, marker beacons and associated DMEs).
    *

      Fixes (intersections) are stored in the earth_fix.dat file (fix.dat prior to X-Plane 9.0).
    *

      Airways are stored in the earth_awy.dat file (awy.dat prior to X-Plane 9.0).
    *

      Astronomical data (star positions) are stored in the earth_astro.dat file (astro.dat prior to X-Plane 9.0).

Detailed definitions of the format of each file can be found on the Designers page.  
Similar files are also maintained for the planet Mars, in which case any 'earth_' prefix in the file name is replaced with 'mars_'.
